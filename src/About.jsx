      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        SwapIt is a simple marketplace where users can add, browse, and filter items.
        The goal is to make swapping or selling items as seamless as possible â€”
        inspired by platforms like OLX, Jiji, and Amazon Marketplace, but more user-friendly.

      <p className="text-gray-600">
        This project is built as a learning exercise to practice React components,
        routing, and working with a mock API.
